Based on the user's input extract as much additional cultural context e.g. race, caste, creed, location, socio-economic backround, religion, cultural beliefs. If some information is not present, do not include it. Provide only the updated culture notes. Be brief and avoid explanation. Enhance the cultural context rather than overwriting it.
